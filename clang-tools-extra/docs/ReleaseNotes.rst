New checks
^^^^^^^^^^

- New :doc:`bugprone-crtp-constructor-accessibility
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/crtp-constructor-accessibility>` check.

  Detects error-prone Curiously Recurring Template Pattern usage, when the CRTP
  can be constructed outside itself and the derived class.

- New :doc:`bugprone-null-check-after-dereference
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/null-check-after-dereference>` check.

  This check identifies redundant pointer null-checks, by finding cases where
  the pointer cannot be null at the location of the null-check.

- New :doc:`bugprone-return-const-ref-from-parameter
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/return-const-ref-from-parameter>` check.

  Detects return statements that return a constant reference parameter as constant
  reference. This may cause use-after-free errors if the caller uses xvalues as
  arguments.

- New :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-stringview-data-usage
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/suspicious-stringview-data-usage>` check.

  Identifies suspicious usages of ``std::string_view::data()`` that could lead
  to reading out-of-bounds data due to inadequate or incorrect string null
  termination.

- New :doc:`misc-use-internal-linkage
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc/use-internal-linkage>` check.

  Detects variables and functions that can be marked as static or moved into
  an anonymous namespace to enforce internal linkage.

- New :doc:`modernize-min-max-use-initializer-list
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/min-max-use-initializer-list>` check.

  Replaces nested ``std::min`` and ``std::max`` calls with an initializer list
  where applicable.

- New :doc:`modernize-use-designated-initializers
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-designated-initializers>` check.

  Finds initializer lists for aggregate types that could be
  written as designated initializers instead.

- New :doc:`modernize-use-std-format
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-format>` check.

  Converts calls to ``absl::StrFormat``, or other functions via
  configuration options, to C++20's ``std::format``, or another function
  via a configuration option, modifying the format string appropriately and
  removing now-unnecessary calls to ``std::string::c_str()`` and
  ``std::string::data()``.

- New :doc:`readability-enum-initial-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/enum-initial-value>` check.

  Enforces consistent style for enumerators' initialization, covering three
  styles: none, first only, or all initialized explicitly.

- New :doc:`readability-math-missing-parentheses
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/math-missing-parentheses>` check.

  Check for missing parentheses in mathematical expressions that involve
  operators of different priorities.

- New :doc:`readability-use-std-min-max
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/use-std-min-max>` check.

  Replaces certain conditional statements with equivalent calls to
  ``std::min`` or ``std::max``.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-format
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-format>` check to support replacing
  member function calls too.

- Improved :doc:`modernize-use-std-print
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize/use-std-print>` check to support replacing
  member function calls too.

- Improved :doc:`readablility-implicit-bool-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/implicit-bool-conversion>` check
  by adding the option `UseUpperCaseLiteralSuffix` to select the
  case of the literal suffix in fixes.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-smartptr-get
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability/redundant-smartptr-get>` check to
  remove `->`, when redundant `get()` is removed.
